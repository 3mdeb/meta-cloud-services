Subject: [PATCH] novaclient: specify full path to test certificate

The tests shipped with novaclient assume that the files
exist at the same location as are appear within the
source tree.  The tests also assume that the test is ran
from the root of the tree. This causes a test to fail as
it can't find a test certificate used in one of the
tests.  This patch fixes the affected test by putting in
an identifier that is replaced with the full path to the
certificate file.
